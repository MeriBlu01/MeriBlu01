Hi, I'm a Mechatronic Engineer with a passion for software development, cloud computing, and data analysis. Also, I'm a Certified Tester and AWS Cloud Practitioner, I combine my engineering background with software testing and cloud expertise to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions. All coding projects included in my GitHub portfolio are built from ideation and planning to design and execution... to be applied to solving real-life problems (well, not all of them, just those that can be solved with code).

I have hands-on experience in several programming languages, including Python, C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
